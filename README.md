# AI-Generated Text Detection Tool

A powerful tool for detecting whether a given text was generated by AI (specifically GPT models) or written by humans. This project uses perplexity analysis with a fine-tuned GPT-2 model to make predictions.

## 🚀 Features

- **Text Analysis**: Analyze any text input to determine if it's AI-generated
- **Perplexity Calculation**: Uses advanced perplexity metrics for accurate detection
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple web interface built with Streamlit
- **Customizable Threshold**: Adjustable detection sensitivity
- **Detailed Documentation**: Comprehensive explanations and usage guidelines

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## 🔧 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Adarsh776/Detection-Tools-for-AI-Generated-Text-and-Recreation-of-Text.git
cd Detection-Tools-for-AI-Generated-Text-and-Recreation-of-Text
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv myenv
# On Windows
myenv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source myenv/bin/activate
```

3. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🛠️ Project Structure

```

├── app.py              # Streamlit web application
├── train.py           # Initial model training script
├── train2.py          # Advanced training with custom dataset
├── requirements.txt   # Project dependencies
└── README.md          # This file
```

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Running the Web Interface**:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

2. **Using the Detection Tool**:
   - Open your web browser and navigate to the provided local URL
   - Enter the text you want to analyze in the text area
   - Click "Evaluate" to see the results
   - The tool will indicate whether the text is likely AI-generated or human-written

## 🔬 How It Works

The tool uses perplexity analysis, which measures how "surprised" the GPT-2 model is by the input text:

1. **Text Processing**: The input text is tokenized and prepared for analysis
2. **Perplexity Calculation**: The model calculates the perplexity score
3. **Classification**: Based on a threshold (default: 50), the text is classified as:
   - AI-generated (perplexity < threshold)
   - Human-written (perplexity ≥ threshold)

## 🧪 Technical Details

- **Model**: GPT-2 (fine-tuned)
- **Tokenization**: GPT-2 Tokenizer
- **Framework**: PyTorch
- **Web Interface**: Streamlit
- **Key Metric**: Perplexity Score

## 📊 Performance

The tool achieves high accuracy in distinguishing between AI-generated and human-written text. The default threshold of 50 has been empirically determined to provide optimal results.

## 🔄 Customization

You can adjust the detection sensitivity by modifying the threshold value in the code:
```python
def is_generated_by_gpt(text, threshold=50):
    perplexity = calculate_perplexity(text)
    return perplexity < threshold
```
